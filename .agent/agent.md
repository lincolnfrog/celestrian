# General
* In order to main context and learn lessons while working, we have a set of living documents that we update as we progress through the project.
* Always capture new learnings about JUCE and related technologies in the tech.md file while working on tasks.
* Always capture design decisions and details in design.md while working on tasks.
* Always capture implementation design decisions and details in implementation.md while working on tasks.
* In general, try to ensure that the key context of your thought process and work is captured in the documents in .agent/. Use this as a system where you can always refer to these documents to understand the context of your work.
